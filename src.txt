I am writing to you - what more? What else can I say? Now I know in your will Punish me with contempt. But you, to my unfortunate share
Though a drop of pity keeping, You won't leave me. At first I wanted to be silent; Believe me: my shame You would never know When I had hope Rarely, at least once a week To see you in our village Just to hear your words You say a word, and thenAll think, think of one And day and night until a new meeting.But, they say, you are unsociable;In the wilderness, in the village, everything is boring for you,And we ... we do not shine with anything,Even though you are welcome.
